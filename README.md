For the calling of ETL module, the job might be aborted due to performance issue, you can click into the notebook and run the ETL part, and no issue should pop up.

For the MLFlow, you may or may not need to change the path as during our implementation we found that we do not have the access to our teammates' experiment path. But for admin, this sort of restriction might not exist.

Thank you for your help and being on call for all times! This has been a great semester and we learned a lot.

Regards,
Group06.
